					<h3>1. Boracay, the most famous beach in the Philippines, is also known as a blessed island. I have never met anyone who has not been enthralled and fascinated when they visited Boracay. The first time you set foot on its powder-like sand, you’ll surely feel lucky to be in a paradise island. The moment you see its crystal pristine water, you’ll be so thankful you’re alive. Many locals and foreigners go there again and again not only because of the breathtaking view but also because to celebrate life and its blessings.

					<h3>2. Malaysia Airline Flight MH370’s disappearance is still under investigation. Many countries joined in the search for what really happened and where the aircraft is now. The flight lost contact with air traffic controllers about an hour after its take off. The weather was fine when the aircraft was flying so it adds more theories about other possible reasons of the aircraft’s fate. The oil slick spotted off Vietnam’s coast turned out to be fuel oil used in cargo ships so it has nothing to do with the aircraft. Interpol also says the disappearance of the jet plane has nothing to do with terrorist attack. More questions are adding to this quest and no specific answer is given and proven yet.

					<h3>3. Flappy Bird, a mobile game created in 2013 by Dong Nguyen from Vietnam became a hit at the start of 2014. At the end of January 2014, it was the most downloaded game in the iOS App Store. The game is extremely addictive and difficult so users strive harder to score higher. Due to its intense popularity, the creator decided to remove it from the App Store. Because of its millions of downloads, Nguyen claimed he was making $50,000 per day from it. The demand of Flappy Bird made some gadgets owners to sell their devices with Flappy Bird installed for twice or thrice their original price.

					<h3>5. Mark Zuckerberg, Co-Founder and CEO of Facebook spoke with President Barack Obama to discuss about internet privacy impositions by the U.S. government. Zuckerberg said, “The Internet works because most people and companies do the same. We work together to create this secure environment and make our shared space even better for the world. This is why I’ve been so confused and frustrated by the repeated reports of the behavior of the U.S. government. When our engineers work tirelessly to improve security, we imagine we’re protecting you against criminals, not our own government. The U.S. government should be the champion for the Internet, not a threat. It needs to be much more transparent about what it’s doing, or people will believe the worst. I’ve called President Obama to express my frustration over the damage the government is creating for all of our future. Unfortunately, it seems like it will take a very long time for true full reform. So it’s up to us — all of us — to build the Internet we want. Together, we can build a space that is greater and a more important part of the world than anything we have today, but is also safe and secure. I’m committed to seeing this happen, and you can count on Facebook to do our part.” Why is Internet Privacy very important to all of us?</h3>

					<h3>8. “In the Olympic Peninsula of northwest Washington State, a small town named Forks exists under a near-constant cover of clouds. It rains on this inconsequential town more than any other place in the United States of America. It was from this town and its gloomy, omnipresent shade that my mother escaped with me when I was only a few months old. It was in this town that I’d been compelled to spend a month every summer until I was fourteen. That was the year I finally put my foot down; these past three summers, my dad, Charlie, vacationed with me in California for two weeks instead. It was to Forks that I now exiled myself – an action that I took with great horror. I detested Forks. I loved Phoenix. I loved the sun and the blistering heat. I loved the vigorous, sprawling city.” -Stephenie Meyer, “The Twilight Saga”. Provide the specific setting of the story</h3>
